# Sentiment Analysis on Covid19 Tweets

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact globally, and during that time, social media became a crucial platform for information sharing and communication. Millions of tweets were posted daily, reflecting public sentiment about the pandemic. 
This project analyzes those tweets to understand how people felt about COVID-19 and to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of the tweets .

## Data Set
This dataset includes manually tagged tweets related to COVID-19. To ensure privacy, names and usernames have been anonymized. The dataset includes the following information:
1. **Location üìç** : The geographical location from where the tweet was posted
2. **Tweet At üìÖ** : The date on which the tweet was posted.
3. **Original Tweet üê¶** :  The content of the tweet.
4. **Sentiment üí¨** : The sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

## Data Analysis
### Sentiment Distribution
- **Sentiment Breakdown**: Of all tweets provided in the dataset, 18.7% are labeled as Neutral, 43.8% as Positive, and 37.5% as Negative.
### Word Cloud
- **Word Clouds**: We generated word clouds to indicate the most common words used in each sentiment category. The size of each word reflects how often it is occuring. Through these word clouds, we could clearly see what kind of the language is associated with each sentiment.
### Most Frequent Locations
- **Top Locations**: The most frequent tweet locations were London, England; United States; India; Australia; and Canada.
### Hashtags and Mentions
- **Top Hashtags**: The most frequently used hashtags were #coronavirus, #covid_19, #Coronavirus, #COVID2019, and #COVID19.
- **Top Mentions**: The most frequently mentioned accounts were @realdonaldtrump, @youtube, @borisjohnson, @tesco, and @amazon.
### Time Series Analysis
- **Tweet Frequency Over Time**: We have plotted a line graph of the number of tweets posted for different sentiments from mid-March to mid-April 2020. This helped us understand how public sentiments have changed during the initial time of the pandemic.

## Text processing

Text preprocessing in the processing of raw text for sentiment analysis is very important. The motive is to clean the text, removing noise through punctuation, special characters, numbers, and irrelevant terms. All the steps used in preprocessing are summarized below: 

-**Twitter Handles**
-**Links and Hashtags**
-**Punctuation and Special Characters**
-**Stop Words**
-**Stemming**
-**Tokenization**

##  Challenges Faced:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Ensuring the text was adequately cleaned and preprocessed for sentiment analysis.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical vectors for model training while retaining meaningful information.
- **Model Training**: Building and optimizing the classification model to improve performance.

## Conclusion:
This project provided valuable insights into public sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic through the analysis of tweets. By preprocessing the text data and leveraging NLP techniques, we successfully built a sentiment classification model. The challenges faced, including text preprocessing, vectorization, and model training, were addressed to improve the accuracy and performance of the model. This analysis not only sheds light on the public's emotional response to the pandemic but also serves as a foundation for further research in social media sentiment analysis.
