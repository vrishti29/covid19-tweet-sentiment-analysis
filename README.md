# Sentiment Analysis on Covid19 Tweets


## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact globally, and during that time, social media became a crucial platform for information sharing and communication. Millions of tweets were posted daily, reflecting public sentiment about the pandemic. 

This project focuses on analyzing those past tweets to understand how people felt about COVID-19, using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) classifier model for sentiment analysis.

## Data Set

The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then. The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns. You can find the dataset here.
